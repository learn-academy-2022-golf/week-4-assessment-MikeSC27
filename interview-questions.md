# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a langueage such as Ruby that emphasizes on data such as classes and objects where objects are instances of the their class. I will have to get back to you with a little more research on the specifics of functional programming other than a langueage such as Javascript based on functional procedure. 

Researched answer: The Ruby object oriented programming is a good way to organize your code in classes or a hash with objects that helps maintain large applications that way you can make changes to without really affecting the entire program especially if there was an error or bug it may stay compartmentalized.  Functional programming is not centered around classes and objects but instead predefined first class functions.  The first class functions in Javascript are required for functional programming that can be passed around same as any value.  This leads to the built in methods that allow you to just call or invoke a function without having to type or build the scripting for the function and this can lead to less coding required.  Anothers words a main difference between the two paradigms are that object oriented programming can be compartmentalized. 


2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: In Ruby, an Integer is always a whole number and Float, not be confused with decimal is a number with in decimal form that includes remainders and if you expect a Float number you must start with a Float number such as 7.0. 

Researched answer: In Ruby any number typed without a decimal will be considered an integer or whole number such as 7.  A float is written in decimal form such as 7.0 but is not as precise in its calculations in Ruby.  You would need to use BigDecimal to have a more precise decimal answer.


3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: The implicit return in Ruby means you do not have to type or command the return of the last line of code or method.

Researched answer:  Within Ruby you do not have to type a return statement, it is going to return the last line of code evaluated. This is a simple and more implied type of coding that Ruby likes to implement.  

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: In Ruby blocks are anonomous functions that are surrounded in scope by do and end or sometimes curly brackets. 

Researched answer: Since we are talking about Ruby and we know there are technically or subjectivly no functions but only methods, well blocks are methods that dont really belong to an object.  They are anonomous or nameless bits of code that can accept arguments in these | |, (as I hold up my arms in a double pipe form, indicating I have kicked this interview right through the uprights for a field goal;). Blocks can be called within the method that it was passed to inside a do and end sytax statement. 

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: In order to extract a value from a key value pair Ruby hash you would need to type puts hash_name.key of the value you want extracted.

Researched answer: If you have a hash and you want to extract from it you can use the the extract method with a bang .extract!(:key).values.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Helps Ruby create a better version of a class.  This is done by passing down methods from parent to child classes. 

2. RSpec: This is a testing framework for Ruby that focuses on behaviors of the code. 

3. CRUD: Create Read Update Delete the four major operations we can do on data utilizing Ruby. 

4. Test-driven development: A testing framework that allows you to test your code scripts seperately. 

5. HTTP: This is a client library you can request by making a GET or POST?  Not to clear on this yet though. Seems like it's from Ruby on Rails framework.
